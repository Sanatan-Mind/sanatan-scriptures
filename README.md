# Sanatan Scriptures Repository

Welcome to the Sanatan Hindu Scriptures repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of ancient Hindu texts that have been carefully digitized and compiled to help train GPT models. By using this repository, we aim to create a fine-tuned model that incorporates the vast knowledge and wisdom present in these ancient texts.

## Overview
The repository includes scriptures from various sources, such as the Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and other classical Hindu texts. These texts have been meticulously cleaned and formatted to ensure they are suitable for training language models.

The main goals of this project are:
- To create a reliable and extensive source of ancient Hindu scriptures in digital format.
- To train GPT models that can understand and generate content based on these scriptures.
- To promote the study and understanding of ancient Hindu wisdom and philosophy.
